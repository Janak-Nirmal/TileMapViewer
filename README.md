** Map Tile Viewer **

This is a simple project to demonstrate two ways of displaying map tiles on a MKMapView, which can be used to show [OpenCycleMap](http://www.opencyclemap.org) tiles or other similar tiled maps.

The first tile overlay method comes from the [Let's Do It World](https://github.com/nutiteq/ldiw-iphone) project by nutiteq.
The second comes from [iOS Map Layer Demo](https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-MapLayerDemo) by MTigas
